<h1>Mac Hagen Downloads Virus on his computer</h1>
<h2>2021/11/16 Tue</h2>
<p style="font-size:24px"><br><br><br>
  Mac Hagen was drawn to a link on the
web that downloads a free version of
Raven Field. He clicked the link causing
the virus in the fake Raven Field file to
expand on his computer. "I tried
everything but it wouldn't budge." Stated
Mac. "This is a newly invented virus
called the KOVID 21" Claimed
Malwarebits.org. Mac FAXed his problem
to Malwarebits.org. The employees took 3
days to figure up a solution. They would
inject antivirus software using the same
way that the virus was injected. They
would hide the file so the hackers won't
see it coming in. They tried to do it and
found it successful. At last, they
commanded Mac Hagen to pay
$10000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
