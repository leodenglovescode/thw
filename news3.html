<h1>Mac Hagen Accidentally Generated Explosion!</h1>
<h2>2021/11/23 Tue</h2>
<p style="font-size:24px"><br><br><br>
    Mac Hagen, decided to try and be a chemist yesterday. He borrowed TJ Rydeen's science lab for experiments. Security cameras videoed Mac Hagen looking into a microscope while jotting down notes. He continues to study for hours. 7 hours later, security cameras videoed that Mac Hagen looks at his
noted while nodding. Next, Mac Hagen opened the cupboard and retrieved several test tubes. He filled one with gass, the other tubes were filled with unknown substance. Firstly he mixed the gas with a greeny fluid which caused pink smoke arising from the tube. Then he carefully mixed the mixture well. He then poured a transparent fluid into the mixed substance, there was a
tremendous amount of light, blinding the cameras. When the light faded, the cameras caught Mac Hagen mixing water into the fluid. He checked a checkbox on his notes. He then poured all of the fluid in all of the test tubes into a measuring cup. At first nothing happened, but then, after 5-6 seconds later, the fluid exploded causing the windows of the lab to shatter. Mac Hagen himself was not hurt. Police
arrived just in time as well as the nurse, Linda, and checked Mac Hagen fully. Hours later, the construction workers started to repair the windows. TJ Rydeen declared that Mac Hagen had mixed an unsustainable substance fluid with H2O2NA3 to create a minor explosion with high frequency.</p>
