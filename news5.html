<h1>Mac Hagen Broke Up With Vasahagen</h1>
<h2>2021/11/6 Tue</h2>
<p style="font-size:24px"><br><br><br>
    Last night, Mac Hagen, a funny teacher and  musician broke apart with the famous magician, <br>Vasahagen at a coffeeshop.  At 11:05 PM,  Vasahagen and  MacHagen walked into Sexy Gray Elephant Café. They were having great relationship.<br> Security  microphones and cameras caught Mac Hagen accidentally spilling a cup of potato soda onto his shirt, ruining his fashion. <br>Vasahagen was disgusted of Mac Hagen's looks by then. She complained about 2 to 3  minutes continuously to Mac Hagen about his un-carefulness.<br> Mac Hagen tried to explain it was an accident and he was a polite and clean man, but all explains were denied by Vasahagen.<br> By 11:25 PM, Vasa Hagen stated she would leave Mac Hagen immediately saying  she  can't <br>maintain the feeling of  the  love  between a  very dirty  and  impolite man. She argued she felt guilty and ashamed of herself when she married Mac Hagen. Mac Hagen begged Vasahagen to stay,  but unfortunately,<br> Vasahagen confidently walked out of the café, leaving Mac Hagen alone crying.<br> After interviewing Mac Hagen's feelings and event with Vasahagen, the reporter found that Vasahagen was a very clean and  polite women.<br> She minded every smudge and every speck of dirt.  Her behavior was  unacceptable to  common people because she  thinks they  are  too dirty. <br> Though Vasahagen refuses  to  be interviewed by the interviewer (becausethe interviewer picks his nose a lot), <br>the reporter can workout that Mac Hagen's behavior was acceptable upon most women but not Vasahagen. <br>The reporter will try to find out more about the two.</p>
