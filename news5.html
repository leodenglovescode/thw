<h1>Mac Hagen Created a COMPANY!</h1>
<h2>2021/12/6 Mon</h2>
<p style="font-size:24px"><br><br><br>
    Mac Hagen opened a company that sells
and produces masks. The company is
called "Mask 'n Masks" According to
MaskPharmacy.com they are having a
bad time selling masks because Mac
Hagen's company produces masks so
rapidly that everyone in the world can
buy enough for themselves. "Mac uses a
technique called the APST (Atoms
Produce Speedily Technique). This
technique is only available to scientists,
but we don't even know how he got this!"
MaskPharmacy.com said. Though the
technique situation continues to be a
mystery, Mac Hagen is dominating the
whole world with masks. "Covid can be
defeated by masks! Buy a mask at
masknmasks.net today!" Said Mac Hagen.
A few days later, Mac Hagen's factory
was struck by lightning. That caused the
machines to malfunction. Masks began to
fill up the APST machine. The machine
then exhausted all of the masks out from
the chimney. "Gosh! It's raining Mask 'n
Masks!" Mr. McFatty said to the
interviewer. "What the heck?" exclaimed
a man passing by the factory. A few
hours later, the masks factory of Mask 'n
Masks around the world all
malfunctions, causing the world to be
covered by masks. "I guess we don't have
to buy masks for a very long time,"
commented Mr. Bigface. Police and the
military are trying to solve the
tremendous mask problem.</p>
