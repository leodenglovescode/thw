<h1>Mac Hagen Was Caught Touching Fish During Meeting</h1>
<h2>2021/11/30 Tue</h2>
<p style="font-size:24px"><br><br><br>
    Last afternoon, Mac Hagen was caught touching fish while meeting with his student's parents. Yesterday was the last day of Parent-Teacher Conference Week of the first quarter of Keystone Academy. Mac Hagen was cozily sitting in his classroom while online chatting with his
    student's parents. But, the only thing he had said to the parents is, "Hello my name is Mac Hagen, I am your child's English teacher, goodbye!" Then he closed his camera and microphone. Kevin Sheedy, who was walking by Mac Hagen's classroom found that he wasn't talking for quite a moment. Kevin Sheedy crawled into Mac Hagen's classroom. Sneaking behind Mac Hagen, he found
    that Mac Hagen was playing Raven Field while gulping down milk tea. Kevin Sheedy snapped a photo of Mac Hagen touching fish and sneaked out of the classroom. Later on, Kevin Sheedy reported the situation to the head of the school. The head of the school center then sent the IT to scan Mac Hagen's computer. The IT didn't find anything related to Raven Field or games that
    were or once were downloaded to Mac's computer. When Kevin Sheedy tried to show the principal the photo he took, he can't find the photo anymore, anywhere. "I swear I took that photo and saw Mac playing games! I swear!" Kevin complained. Though this continues to be a mystery, Mac Hagen suddenly disappeared, like the games and photo.</p>
